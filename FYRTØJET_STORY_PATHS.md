# Fyrtøjet - Three Main Story Paths

## Path 1: The Jail Escape & King's Victory 🏰👑

**The Classic Andersen Story Path**

1. **Meeting the Witch** - You meet an old witch on a dusty road who offers you money to retrieve a tinderbox from a hollow tree.

2. **The Hollow Tree** - You climb down into the dark, magical tree and find coins (gold, silver, copper) and a mysterious tinderbox that pulses with blue energy. Despite the witch's warnings, you take the tinderbox.

3. **Learning Magic** - You escape with the tinderbox and learn it contains three magical dogs (large, medium, small) that you can summon by striking the tinderbox.

4. **The Castle** - You go to the castle where the king tells you the princess has been kidnapped. You use the tinderbox to have the dogs bring the princess to you so you can see her.

5. **The Arrest** - The king and queen discover the princess was taken and you're arrested, sentenced to death, and thrown in jail.

6. **The Jail Scene** ⭐ - **This is the key scene!** In jail, you use the tinderbox to call the three magical dogs. They come to you in your cell.

7. **The Escape** - The dogs help you escape: the large dog breaks the iron bars, the medium dog carries you out, and the small dog guards the way.

8. **Confrontation** - You confront the king and queen with the dogs at your side. The dogs defeat the guards, and you have the power to decide their fate.

9. **Ending: King & Marriage** - You become king AND marry the princess. You rule with wisdom and justice, using the tinderbox and dogs to protect the kingdom. You achieve both power and love.

**The Noble Path**

3. **The Castle** - You go to the castle and offer to help the desperate king rescue his daughter.

4. **The Rescue** - You use the tinderbox to call the three magical dogs and ask them to find and rescue the princess. The dogs return with the princess, safe and grateful.

5. **The Reward** - The king is overwhelmed with joy and offers you anything you want.

6. **Ending Options:**

## Path 3: The Moral Choice 🌿✨

**The Righteous Path**

1. **Meeting the Witch** - You meet the witch and retrieve the tinderbox from the hollow tree.

2. **The Choice** - After learning about the tinderbox's power (or after the witch offers to teach you), you face a moral decision.

3. **Return to Witch** - You decide to return the tinderbox to the witch, understanding that it's dangerous if it falls into the wrong hands.

4. **Ending: The Witch's Protection** - The witch is relieved and thanks you. She protects the tinderbox from those who would misuse its magic. You receive a reward (coins or a blessing) and go your way. You may not have achieved great magic or wealth, but you did the right thing. The world is safe, and you can live a normal life with a clear conscience.

## Key Differences

- **Path 1 (Jail)** - Most dramatic, includes the classic jail scene with dogs, leads to ultimate power (king + marriage)
- **Path 2 (Rescue)** - Heroic path, direct rescue of princess, leads to marriage OR kingship
- **Path 3 (Witch)** - Moral path, prioritizing safety over power, peaceful ending

All three paths start the same way but diverge based on your choices about the tinderbox and how you use (or don't use) its magic.
