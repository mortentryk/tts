1,"You stand backstage at the largest bookstore in Copenhagen. Your debut novel ""The Silent Words"" has been on the bestseller list for three weeks. The audience of 200 people waits eagerly. But as you step toward the microphone, your throat closes. Your hands shake. The words you've practiced for weeks disappear from your mind. You freeze, unable to speak.",Take a deep breath and try again,2,Excuse yourself and leave,3,Ask for help from the event organizer,4,,,,,,,The Voice Within,A therapeutic journey story about overcoming public speaking anxiety through healing modalities around the world.,45-60 min,18+
2,"You try to speak, but your voice cracks. The audience grows restless. Someone in the front row whispers. You feel the weight of 200 pairs of eyes. Your heart races. This isn't working.",Continue to the green room,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,"Your publisher hands you a business card: """"Dr. Elena Vasquez - Hypnotherapist. She's helped many performers overcome stage fright.""""""",Visit Dr. Elena's office,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,"The event organizer, a kind woman named Sarah, notices your distress. ""Don't worry, honey. This happens to the best of us. I know someone who can help."" She writes down a name: Dr. Elena Vasquez.",Visit Dr. Elena's office,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,"She sits across from you with a notepad. """"Before we begin any work, I'd like to understand your experience better. Can you tell me - when else does this anxiety happen? Is it only when speaking publicly, or does it occur in other situations too?""""""",It happens in other situations too,5b,It's mainly just public speaking,5c,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5b,"Dr. Elena nods, making notes. ""I see. Can you give me some examples? Does it happen in job interviews? Meetings at work? Social situations? When ordering at a restaurant?""","Yes, in job interviews and meetings",5d,Mainly in social situations,5e,It's mostly just public speaking,5c,,,,,,,,,,
5c,"Dr. Elena writes something down. ""Okay, so it's specifically tied to speaking in front of groups. That's actually quite common. Can you tell me - when did this first start? Was there a specific event, or has it always been this way?""",There was a specific event,5f,It's always been this way,5g,,,,,,,,,,,,
5d,"Dr. Elena looks up from her notes. ""So it's not just public speaking - it's any situation where you feel evaluated or judged. That's important information. This suggests the fear is deeper than just stage fright. It's about being seen, being vulnerable, being judged.""",That sounds right,5h,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5e,"Dr. Elena considers this. ""Social anxiety and performance anxiety often overlap. The fear of being judged can manifest in many ways. This helps me understand what we're working with.""",Continue,5h,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5f,"Dr. Elena leans forward slightly. ""Can you tell me about that event? You don't have to go into detail if it's too difficult, but understanding the origin can help us address it more effectively.""",I can talk about it,5i,I'd rather not go into detail,5h,,,,,,,,,,,,
5g,"Dr. Elena nods. ""Sometimes anxiety develops gradually, without a clear trigger. That's okay - we can still work with it. The important thing is understanding how it affects you now.""",Continue,5h,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5h,"She gestures to a comfortable reclining chair. """"Are you ready to begin your first session?""""""",Yes I'm ready,5j,I'm nervous about hypnosis,6,Can you explain what will happen?,7,,,,,,,,,,,
5i,"When you finish, she says, """"Thank you for trusting me with that. These early experiences can create patterns that our subconscious mind tries to protect us from, but sometimes that protection becomes a prison. We're going to help you break free.""""""",Continue,5h,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,"Dr. Elena smiles understandingly. ""That's completely normal. Hypnosis isn't about losing control - it's about gaining it. You'll be aware of everything. You can stop at any time. It's simply a state of deep relaxation where your subconscious mind is more open to positive suggestions. Think of it like guided meditation, but more focused.""",I understand - I'm ready,5j,I still have questions,7,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,"Dr. Elena explains: ""During hypnosis, you'll be in a deeply relaxed state, similar to when you're just about to fall asleep. I'll guide you through visualization exercises and positive affirmations. Your conscious mind will be quiet, allowing your subconscious to accept new patterns of thinking. Many people find it incredibly peaceful and transformative.""",That sounds helpful - let's begin,5j,I need more time to think,8,,,,,,,,,,,,

8,"Dr. Elena smiles. ""You did beautifully, Maya. But this is just the beginning. True healing often requires exploring different approaches. I have a colleague in South Africa - a traditional healer who works with the power of voice and rhythm. Would you like to visit her?""",Yes I'll go to South Africa,9,I want to try more sessions here first,10,I'm not sure about traditional healing,11,,,,,,,,,,

10,"Dr. Elena nods. ""Of course. We can do several more sessions here. Sometimes local work is enough. But I've found that when people are truly stuck, a change of environment can be transformative. The choice is yours.""",I'll go to South Africa,9,Let's do more sessions here,10a,,,,,,,,,,,,
10a,"You continue working with Dr. Elena for two more weeks. Each session deepens your relaxation and helps you reframe your thoughts about speaking. You feel progress, but something still feels incomplete. Dr. Elena notices. ""Maya, I think you're ready for the next step. Sometimes we need to experience different approaches to fully heal.""",I'm ready to try South Africa,9,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,"Dr. Elena understands. ""I know it might seem unusual, but traditional healing has wisdom that modern therapy sometimes misses. Mama Thandi works with the body's natural rhythms and the power of voice in ways that complement what we've started here. But if you're not comfortable, we can explore other options.""",I'll trust you - let's go,9,I'd prefer a different approach,16,,,,,,,,,,,,
