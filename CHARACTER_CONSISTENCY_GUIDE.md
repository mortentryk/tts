# 🎭 Character Consistency System - Complete Guide

## 🎯 **What This System Does**

The Character Consistency System ensures that the same characters appear consistently throughout your story, with the same appearance, clothing, and facial features in every image.

## 🚀 **How It Works**

### **1. Character Creation**
- Create character profiles with names, descriptions, and reference images
- Add appearance prompts for AI generation
- Store character data in the database

### **2. Character Assignment**
- Assign characters to specific story nodes/scenes
- Define character roles, emotions, and actions
- Link characters to story progression

### **3. AI Image Generation**
- AI uses character information to create consistent images
- Characters maintain the same appearance across all scenes
- Emotions and actions are reflected in the generated images

## 📊 **Database Schema**

### **Characters Table**
```sql
- id: Unique character ID
- story_id: Links to story
- name: Character name
- description: Character background
- reference_image_url: Reference image for consistency
- appearance_prompt: AI prompt for character appearance
```

### **Character Assignments Table**
```sql
- story_id: Links to story
- node_key: Links to story node
- character_id: Links to character
- role: Character role in scene (main, secondary, background)
- emotion: Character emotion (happy, sad, angry, etc.)
- action: Character action (standing, running, talking, etc.)
```

## 💡 **Best Practices**

### **Character Descriptions**
```
Good: "Princess Elara, 20 years old, long blonde hair, blue eyes, wearing a white dress with gold trim, kind expression"

Bad: "A princess"
```

### **Appearance Prompts**
```
Good: "tall, blonde hair, blue eyes, wearing a white dress, kind smile, regal posture"

Bad: "pretty"
```

### **Character Assignments**
- **Main characters**: Assign to most scenes

```

### **Character Assignment System**
```typescript
interface CharacterAssignment {
  characterId: string;
  role: 'main' | 'secondary' | 'background';
